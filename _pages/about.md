## A bit more on what I've done and what I'm working towards...
In the past I’ve interned at NASA (aerospace engineering), conducted semiconductor memory research in Stanford’s Nanoelectronics Lab with Philip Wong, and spent the last couple summers in finance (strategy at DE Shaw and quant trading at PEAK6). After those experiences, I’m looking to get **more hands-on with hardware** and move into **digital design**. I’m about two-thirds through my M.S., with graduate coursework in VLSI, computer systems architecture, digital systems design, EDA, and ML hardware. I have programming experience in C, C++, Python, Verilog, and SystemVerilog, and I’m particularly interested in ASIC/SoC design and RTL work. 

While my hardware experience is mostly academic, I’m eager to learn quickly on the job and **contribute wherever I can in the industry**.
