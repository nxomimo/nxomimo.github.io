This was my final project for EE108, Stanford's undergraduate course in digital systems design.


This was my final project for [CS107E](https://cs107e.github.io/about/), Stanford's intensive systems programming course taught on Raspberry Pi. Although my group was inspired by online resources (namely [this one](https://youtu.be/g7_VKGsEKeA)), we coded every module for the project ourselves in C on Raspberry Pi, including the hall sensor driver, the LED driver, and the timing algorithm.

This project was made possible by my awesome project partners (shoutout Didi and Aanya!), many nights in Stanford's Lab64, and my friend Frances' loaned Honeywell fan. We were on a tight deadline and had to source parts quicklyâ€”hence our mangling of the Honeywell fan for its motor-but we were quite satsfied with the final product as we managed to display a soccer ball!

You can view photos, code, and further descriptions of our work on [the project GitHub, hosted on Didi's repository](https://github.com/didikamalova/POV-Display-RaspberryPi). Unfortunately, videos of the project do not compliment the "persistence of vision" effect as camera frame rates are faster than those of our eyes.
