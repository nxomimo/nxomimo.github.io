A spherical persistence of vision (POV) LED Display that works by spinning a circular array of LEDs and relies on the eyes' natural “refresh rates” to create the illusion of a solid, continuous image on a sphere. Equipped with an LED strip, a hall sensor, 3 battery packs and framed in a disassembled desk fan, it creates patterns upon reacting to magnets spaced out across the circular base.

This was my final project for [CS107E](https://cs107e.github.io/about/), Stanford's intensive systems programming course taught on Raspberry Pi. It was made possible by my awesome project partners (shoutout Didi and Aanya!), many nights in Stanford's Lab64, and my friend Frances' loaned Honeywell fan. We were on a tight deadline and had to source out parts quickly, hence our mangling of the Honeywell fan for its motor, but we were quite satisfied with the final product as we managed to display a soccer ball!

You can view photos, code, and further descriptions of our work on [the project GitHub, hosted on Didi's repository](https://github.com/didikamalova/POV-Display-RaspberryPi).
