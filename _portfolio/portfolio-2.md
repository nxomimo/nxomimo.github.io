My final lab objective for my Circuits II class was to create a functional speaker system utilizing Texas Instruments' TPA3122D2 EVM schematic. Tasks for this project included:

* planning where to arrange components
* soldering components onto a blank PCB
* soldering in an audio jack through which a Bluetooth/FM transmitter interfaces
* forming output connections to two speakers
* testing and troubleshooting any bad connections
* jamming out!
