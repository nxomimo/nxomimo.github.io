I often write poetry in my spare time as a form of catharsis: a methodology to process what I've been through, as well as reflect on where I'm going. I rarely share my poetry with others, but I'm challenging myself this year to start submitting to journals more often. If you would like to read the poem, you can find it [here](https://issuu.com/lelandquarterly/docs/lqfall2022_11479_).
