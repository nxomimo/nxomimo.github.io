Personal poem published in Leland Quarterly's 2022 Fall Issue: "In Newness of Life". Leland Quarterly is Stanford's premier literary magazine for writing, art, and creative expression.

I often write poetry in my spare time as a form of catharsis: a method to process what I've been through, as well as reflect on where I'm going. If you would like to read this poem, you can find it [here](https://issuu.com/lelandquarterly/docs/lqfall2022_11479_) on page 19.
