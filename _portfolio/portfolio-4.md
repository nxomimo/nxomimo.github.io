As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf#:~:text=The%20printf%20family%20of%20functions,specifier%20and%20given%20input%20values.) describes it, the **printf** family of functions in the C programming language are "a set of functions that take a format string as input" and "produce as output a string that corresponds to the format specifier and given input values."

As part of my systems programming class, I wrote my own version of a string processing module and basic printf module in C on bare-metal Raspberry Pi. Lots of tricky pointers involved! You can observe the code for this project in its [GitHub repository](https://gitfront.io/r/nxomimo/aZgVjkJbEh3A/printf/).
