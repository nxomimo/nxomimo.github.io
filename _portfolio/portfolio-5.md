## Overview
The [printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf#:~:text=The%20printf%20family%20of%20functions,specifier%20and%20given%20input%20values.) family of functions in the C programming language are "a set of functions that take a format string as input" and "produce as output a string that corresponds to the format specifier and given input values."

I wrote my own version of a string processing module and printf module (complete with basic ARM assembly decoding functionality) in C on bare-metal Raspberry Pi. Lots of tricky pointers involved!
