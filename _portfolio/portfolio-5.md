One assignment in my computer systems class was to implement a basic dynamic memory allocator on bare-metal Raspberry Pi. If you'd like to look at my implementation, feel free to check out this [link to the GitHub repository](https://gitfront.io/r/nxomimo/jNxf6mr69M68/malloc/). Note that heap_workflow.c and nameless.c were already provided to me; I only implemented malloc.c, backtrace.c, and the testing file.
